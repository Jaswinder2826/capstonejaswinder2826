Capstone project - Astronomy picture of the day
##Part-3

I created an index.html file to display the layout of the site, the top part contains a search form so user can enter a date and get an image of the day. below that is the picture of the day. and it's description. under it is the favorites button. which will add the image to the favorites. user can also get to the favorites section by clicking the favorites button next to search form.

the styles.css file adds layout and styling to the site, including the font family, font size, and the margin and padding of the elements.

# Part-4

I added the scriipt.js file that gets the data from the NASA API and displays the image of the day. It adds a click event listener to the favorites button which will add the image to the favorites section. and event-listener to the delete button which will delete the image from the favorites section.
